##		Plot
This is a Sonic fan game that retells the story of all relevant Sonic the Hedgehog games starring Sonic the Hedgehog and his nemesis, Dr. Ivo Robotnik AKA the Eggman from the very beginning (before Sonic 1) to Sonic Forces--maybe Sonic Frontiers as that will come soon as of writing this manual.
###		Episodes with games featured:
####	Episode 0: Sayonara, Kintobor! (None)
This episode is an original story that acts as a prologue to Sonic 1. It will explain how Sonic and Eggman came to be using the Kintobor origin.
####	Episode 1: Eggs-actly! I am the Eggman! (Sonic 1)
This episode will remix the story of Sonic 1.
####	Episode 2: Chaos! Enter Tails (Sonic 2 + Chaos)
These 2 games involve Tails and have similar plots: stop Eggman, so they will be crunched in this game.
####	Episode 3: Prediction! Amy Rose's Bizzare First Date (Sonic CD)
This game is very strange to put between Sonic 2 and 3, and it introduces Amy Rose/Rosy the Rascal and Metal Sonic, so this episode's plot will be a complete remix of the CD plot.
####	Episode 4: The Master Emerald! Tragedy on the Floating Island (Sonic 3 & Knuckles)
Sonic 3 and Knuckles is a huge plot element in the Sonic series and introduces Knuckles and much lore on the Emeralds. The plots of these games will be crunched and remixed.
####	Episode 5: Double-Crossed! Knuckles' Chaotix (Knuckles Chaotix + Sonic Triple Trouble)
Knuckle's Chaotix may have sucked, but the story is pretty useful as an aftermath for Sonic 3+Knuckles. This game and Triple Trouble introduce Fang the Sniper, team Chaotix, and the Hooligans. I'm replacing Fiona the Fox with Rouge the Bat here since the latter shows up unexplained in the later games and the former is comic-exclusive.
####	Episode 6: Vacation to Earth! Sonic's Advanced Adventure (Sonic Adventure + Advance 1, 2, 3)
These games were introduced in the same way: Sonic comes to Earth. This episode will crunch the plots of these games into one entity.
####	Episode 7: Chaos Control! Shadow on the Ark (Sonic Adventure 2 + Shadow the Hedgehog)
Sonic Adventure 2, Sonic Heroes, and Shadow the Hedgehog introduce and expand upon Shadow the Hedgehog. Each game retells Shadow's amnesia story over and over, so this episode will condense the Shadow arc into one episode.
####	Episode 8: It's No Use! A Silver Flame on Planet Mobius (Sonic 2006 + Sonic Rush)
Sonic '06 and Rush introduce Silver the Hedgehog and Blaze the Cat. These characters were introduced in a similar fashion, so they are planned to be introduced at the same time within this episode.
####	Episode 9: Hyper-Go-On! 7 Shades of Emerald (Sonic Colors + Lost World)
Sonic Colors and Lost World introduce and expand upon the Wisps. The Wisps will be remixed into the lore so that they will be involved with the Emeralds.
####	Episode 10: Generations of Freedom! Maniacal Forces Unite (Sonic Generations/Forces + Mania)
Generations, Mania, and Forces are basically the same game in terms of plot, where they celebrate Sonic's history through a mish-mash of previous levels. Mania/Forces were low-key tie-ins, and introduce the Phantom Ruby, Hard-Boiled Heavies (upgraded EggRobos), and Infinite. This episode will usher the end of the story.
####	Episode 11: Sayonara, Robotnik!
This episode will wrap up the story, if needed.
